abstract: "Fuzzing is a practical, widely-deployed technique to find bugs in complex,\
  \ real-world programs like JavaScript engines. We observed, however, that existing\
  \ fuzzing approaches, either generative or mutational, fall short in fully harvesting\
  \ high-quality input corpora such as known proof of concept (PoC) exploits or unit\
  \ tests. Existing fuzzers tend to destruct subtle semantics or conditions encoded\
  \ in the input corpus in order to generate new test cases because this approach\
  \ helps in discovering new code paths of the program. Nevertheless, for JavaScript-like\
  \ complex programs, such a conventional design leads to test cases that tackle only\
  \ shallow parts of the complex codebase and fails to reach deep bugs effectively\
  \ due to the huge input space.\n\nIn this paper, we advocate a new technique, called\
  \ an aspect-preserving mutation, that stochastically preserves the desirable properties,\
  \ called aspects, that we prefer to be maintained across mutation. We demonstrate\
  \ the aspect preservation with two mutation strategies, namely, structure and type\
  \ preservation, in our fully-fledged JavaScript fuzzer, called DIE. Our evaluation\
  \ shows that DIE's aspect-preserving mutation is more effective in discovering new\
  \ bugs (5.7 x more unique crashes) and producing valid test cases (2.4 x fewer runtime\
  \ errors) than the state-of-the-art JavaScript fuzzers. DIE newly discovered 48\
  \ high-impact bugs in ChakraCore, JavaScriptCore, and V8 (38 fixed with 12 CVEs\
  \ assigned as of today). The source code of DIE is publicly available as an open-source\
  \ project.\n"
