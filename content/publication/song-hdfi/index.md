abstract: "Memory corruption vulnerabilities are the root cause of many\nmodern attacks.\
  \ Existing defense mechanisms are inadequate; in\ngeneral, the software-based approaches\
  \ are not efficient and the\nhardware-based approaches are not flexible. In this\
  \ paper, we present\nhardware-assisted data-flow isolation, or, Hdfi, a new fine-grained\n\
  data isolation mechanism that is broadly applicable and very efficient.\nHdfi enforces\
  \ isolation at the machine word granularity by virtually\nextending each memory\
  \ unit with an additional tag that is defined\nby data-flow.  This capability allows\
  \ Hdfi to enforce a variety of\nsecurity models such as the Biba Integrity Model\
  \ and the Bell--LaPadula\nModel. We implemented Hdfi by extending the RISC-V instruction\
  \ set\narchitecture (ISA) and instantiating it on the Xilinx Zynq ZC706\nevaluation\
  \ board. We ran several benchmarks including the SPEC CINT\n2000 benchmark suite.\
  \  Evaluation results show that the performance\noverhead caused by our modification\
  \ to the hardware is low (<2%). We\nalso developed or ported several security mechanisms\
  \ to leverage\nHdfi, including stack protection, standard library enhancement,\n\
  virtual function table protection, code pointer protection, kernel\ndata protection,\
  \ and information leak prevention.  Our results show\nthat Hdfi is easy to use,\
  \ imposes low performance overhead, and allows\nus to create more elegant and more\
  \ secure solutions.\n"
