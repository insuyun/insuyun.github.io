abstract: "Recently, hybrid fuzzing has been proposed to address the limitations of\n\
  fuzzing and concolic execution by combining both approaches. The hybrid\napproach\
  \ has shown its effectiveness in various synthetic benchmarks such as\nDARPA Cyber\
  \ Grand Challenge (CGC) binaries, but it still suffers from scaling\nto find bugs\
  \ in complex, real-world software. We observed that the performance\nbottleneck\
  \ of the existing concolic executor is the main limiting factor for\nits adoption\
  \ beyond a small-scale study.\n\nTo overcome this problem, we design a fast concolic\
  \ execution engine, called\nQSYM, to support hybrid fuzzing. The key idea is to\
  \ tightly integrate the\nsymbolic emulation with the native execution using dynamic\
  \ binary translation,\nmaking it possible to implement more fine-grained, so faster,\
  \ instruction-level\nsymbolic emulation. Additionally, QSYM loosens the strict soundness\n\
  requirements of conventional concolic executors for better performance, yet\ntakes\
  \ advantage of a faster fuzzer for validation, providing unprecedented\nopportunities\
  \ for performance optimizations, e.g., optimistically solving\nconstraints and pruning\
  \ uninteresting basic blocks.\n\nOur evaluation shows that QSYM does not just outperform\
  \ state-of-the-art\nfuzzers (i.e., found 14Ã— more bugs than VUzzer in the LAVA-M\
  \ dataset, and\noutperformed Driller in 104 binaries out of 126), but also found\
  \ 13 previously\nunknown security bugs in eight real-world programs like Dropbox\
  \ Lepton, ffmpeg,\nand OpenJPEG, which have already been intensively tested by the\n\
  state-of-the-art fuzzers, AFL and OSS-Fuzz.\n"
