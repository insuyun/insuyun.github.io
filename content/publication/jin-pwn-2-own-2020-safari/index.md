abstract: "Compromising a kernel through a browser is the ultimate goal for offensive\
  \ security researchers. Because of continuous efforts to eliminate vulnerabilities\
  \ and introduce various mitigations, a remote kernel exploit from a browser becomes\
  \ extremely difficult, seemingly impossible.\n\nIn this talk, we will share our\
  \ Safari exploit submitted to Pwn2Own 2020. Combining *SIX* different vulnerabilities,\
  \ our exploit successfully compromises the macOS kernel starting from the Safari\
  \ browser. It breaks every mitigation in macOS including ASLR, DEP, sandbox, and\
  \ even System Integrity Protection (SIP). Inspecting every vulnerability used in\
  \ this exploit, we will show not only state-of-the-art hacking techniques but also\
  \ challenges in protecting complicated systems (i.e., browsers and operating systems)\
  \ and in introducing their mitigations. Moreover, we will introduce a new technique\
  \ that reliably exploits a TOCTOU vulnerability in macOS.\n\n"
