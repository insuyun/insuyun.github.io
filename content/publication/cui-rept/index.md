abstract: "Debugging software failures in deployed systems is important because they\n\
  impact real users and customers. However, debugging such failures is\nnotoriously\
  \ hard in practice because developers have to rely on limited\ninformation such\
  \ as memory dumps. The execution history is usually unavailable\nbecause high-fidelity\
  \ program tracing is not affordable in deployed systems.\n\nIn this paper, we present\
  \ REPT, a practical system that enables reverse\ndebugging of software failures\
  \ in deployed systems. REPT reconstructs the\nexecution history with high fidelity\
  \ by combining online lightweight hardware\ntracing of a program's control flow\
  \ with offline binary analysis that recovers\nits data flow. It is seemingly impossible\
  \ to recover data values thousands of\ninstructions before the failure due to information\
  \ loss and concurrent\nexecution. REPT tackles these challenges by constructing\
  \ a partial execution\norder based on timestamps logged by hardware and iteratively\
  \ performing forward\nand backward execution with error correction.\n\nWe design\
  \ and implement REPT, deploy it on Microsoft Windows, and integrate it\ninto Windows\
  \ Debugger. We evaluate REPT on 16 real-world bugs and show that it\ncan recover\
  \ data values accurately (92% on average) and efficiently (less than\n20 seconds)\
  \ for these bugs. We also show that it enables effective reverse\ndebugging for\
  \ 14 bugs.\n"
