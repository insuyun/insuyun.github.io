abstract: "Exploitation techniques to abuse metadata of heap allocators have been\
  \ widely studied because of their generality (i.e., application independence) and\
  \ powerfulness (i.e., bypassing modern mitigation). However, such techniques are\
  \ commonly considered arts, and thus the ways to discover them remain ad-hoc, manual,\
  \ and allocator-specific.\n\nIn this paper, we present an automatic tool, ArcHeap,\
  \ to systematically discover the unexplored heap exploitation primitives, regardless\
  \ of their underlying implementations. The key idea of ArcHeap is to let the computer\
  \ autonomously explore the spaces, similar in concept to fuzzing, by specifying\
  \ a set of common designs of modern heap allocators and root causes of vulnerabilities\
  \ as models, and by providing heap operations and attack capabilities as actions.\
  \ During the exploration, ArcHeap checks whether the combinations of these actions\
  \ can be potentially used to construct exploitation primitives, such as arbitrary\
  \ write or overlapped chunks. As a proof, ArcHeap generates working PoC that demonstrates\
  \ the discovered exploitation technique.\n\nWe evaluated ArcHeap with ptmalloc2\
  \ and 10 other allocators, and discovered five previously unknown exploitation techniques\
  \ in ptmalloc2 as well as several techniques against seven out of 10 allocators\
  \ including the security-focused allocator, DieHarder. To show the effectiveness\
  \ of ArcHeap's approach in other domains, we also studied how security features\
  \ and exploit primitives evolve across different versions of ptmalloc2.\n"
